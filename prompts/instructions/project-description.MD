## Project name: Super predict

## Context
Superseed blockchain launched a contest with a prize pool of $34750. The contest is about building a game around Superseed's values & identity using AI.

## Keywords
engaging, gamification, awareness, points, leaderboard, community, retention, competitive, airdrop, time-based.

## Idea
A web app where users engage in a gamified experience with time cooldown, earn points, climb the leaderboard and share the SUPR prize pool.

## Key points:
- Users will earn points by playing a quick game
- Game: A prediction game where users makes bets (with virtual coins) on the ETH price (greater or lower) after 1 minute.
- If the game wins the competition, $25000 will be used to buy SUPR tokens over the first 5 weeks of launch (or date of receiving the prize) to build the Super predict prize pool.
- Top 60% leaderboard users will share the SUPR prize pool in 5 phases ($5000 each)
- After mainnet launch, genesis seeders will be able to connect with their wallet and have a generous boost in points.
- After mainnet launch, users will benefit from Superseed's points system to increase their points (% TDB)
- If the game does not won the competition, we had fun playing & building it

## Game mechanics:
- Users log in via X (Twitter) and this is their identifier.
- All users receive 100 coins every hour and cannot stack more than 1000.
- Playing a game costs coins (100 - 500) and earns points (bet x 2)
- Game steps:
    1. User sets the bet size (100-500 coins), the prediction on ETH price (long, short) after 1 minute and starts the game
    2. User sees a chart of ETH's price vs his prediction during the 1 minute timeframe
    3. Game ends 1 minute after it started and user wins bet x 2 in points if the prediction was correct or bet x 0.1 points if the prediction was wrong.
- Points will determine the leaderboard and users will receive SUPR tokens in multiple phases
